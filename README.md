# Pulling it all together

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will integrate all of the knowledge we have built up in the first third of the course.

## Instructions

Work with your pair to define a simple product vision based on the API or APIs you find interest. That is - what do you two want to build? ***Do not spend more than 15-20 minutes figuring this out***.

But what does this consist of in a more concrete way?

1. Do a mini-inception to figure out what the project goals are
1. Continue with mini-inception to figure out what roles (or personas), workflows, and activities are. Use notecars to begin drafting out what stories you need to work on (do not bother weighting them) and prioritize that work to work towards MVP.
1. Have a quick architecture discussion - how do you want to structure this application? Is it server-side rendering? Is it an API with SPA?

If you want to take it a step further, go ahead and register a free [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/) account and create a project to track your work. Obviously you will need to have a shorter cycle around things like acceptance (and accept your own work), but it will at least be a good chance to get used to keeping the tool up to date.

If you really want to go for gold, work on each of your features in a feature branch which is then merged into `master` at the end of the feature (and passing of tests).

## Hard Project Requirements

* The application must be built using TDD

## Stretch

- Deploy your application to PCF
- Make it pretty! Use a CSS library, or roll your own, to style the page
- Does your application have a pleasant UX or is it just the absolute minimum you can do? If it is the absolute minimum possible; kudos, defining and achieving an MVP is more important than an optimal UX out of the gate. Now that your startup is funded though; what can you do to improve the UX of your application? What about the UI/appearance of your application?
- If you decided to use React for your project, figure out how to test the React components.
